# Contributing

Here are some sample ways how to contribute:

 - bug hunting
 - proof-reading the comments and documentation
 - improving unit test coverage
 - performance tweaking (without significantly sacrificing readability of the code)

There following rules have to be taken into account before sending a pull request:

  - each new function should have a unit test
  - run `cargo test` to ensure that the unit tests pass
  - run `cargo fmt` to keep the coding style of the crate consistent
  - use of `unsafe` code is forbidden
