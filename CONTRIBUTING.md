# Contributing

Here are some ways to contribute:

 - bug hunting
 - proof-reading the comments and documentation
 - improving test case coverage
 - performance tweaking (without sacrificing readability of the code, though)

Each new function should have a test case. Before sending a pull request, please, run `cargo test` 
to ensure all the unit tests pass and `cargo fmt` to keep the coding style consistent.
