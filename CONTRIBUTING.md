# Contributing

Bug hunting (and even fixing), performance tweaking, proof-reading the comments, improving test case 
coverage and any other enhancements are welcome. Each new function should have a test case. Before 
sending a pull request, please, run `cargo fmt` to keep the coding style consistent.
